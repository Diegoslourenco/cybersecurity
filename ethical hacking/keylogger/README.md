# Keylogger - Keystroke Logging



`Keyloggers` can be software programs or hardware devices that track the activities of a keyboard to monitor activities or maliciously gain access to private informatios. 

Besides that, a keylogger can also capture screens at set intervals, keep tracking everything that is copied and pasted, monitor the mouse movements or GPS location, record the audio and camera.

All the data collected could be saved in a file or sent back to a third party via email or uploaded to some websites, databases, or FTP servers.



## keylogger.py

The file is a simple keylloger that saves the keys pressed in a file called `logs.txt`. It saves the key pressed and the date time that this event happened. In order to avoid that it runs forever, a timer of 10 seconds was set. The output file is below.

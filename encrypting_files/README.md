# Encrypt / Decrypt files

Functions in the `file_encrypt.py`:

* `open_file()` opens a file and returns its content.

* `export_file()` receives content and export as a file.

* `encrypt_transposition()` receives a file and a key and cipher its content using the transposition method.

* `decrypt_transposition()` receives a file and a key and returns the original content.

<br>

Running the `main.py`, the content from the book `tomsawyer.txt` will be encrypted using the key value of 15. The content is in the file `encrypted_tomsawyer.txt`.<br>
After that, the content will be decrypted back to the original content and saved at `decrypted_encrypted_tomsawyer.txt`.
